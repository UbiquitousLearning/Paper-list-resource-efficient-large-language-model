Target venues: system conferences (OSDI/SOSP/ATC/EuroSys/ASPLOS), network conferences (NSDI/SIGCOMM), mobile conferences (MobiCom/MobiSys/SenSys/UbiComp), AI conferences (NeurIPS/ACL/ICLR/ICML)

We will keep maintaining this list :)

Note: We only focus on inference now. We plan to involve training work in the future.
